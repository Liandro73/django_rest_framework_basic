# organizador_financeiro_api

This project was generated using Django 5.3.1.

## Initial configs

You will need python and pip.

To install all required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code scaffolding

To create a new app, run:

```bash
python manage.py startapp <'app_name'>
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
If you make several changes in your code, try quitting the server with CONTROL-C. Then repeat the 'Development server' steps.
